needed, and to collaborate with my peers to create an environment of
shared knowledge and mutual support. The Fab Academy is not just a

challenges, the discoveries, and the growth that will undoubtedly
unfold. My commitment to being studious is not only a promise to
myself but also a commitment to contribute meaningfully to the Fab
